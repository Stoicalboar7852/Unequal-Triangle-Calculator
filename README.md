# Unequal-Triangle-Calculator
This is for a school project, and takes 3 side lengths, first calculates if it can make a triangle, then displays the triangle showing the side lengths and angles.

# How it works:
It will first take all the values, and then sort them from smallest to largest.
Once sorted, the sum of the first 2 values (the smallest 2) is subtracted from the third value (the largest value). If the result is negative, it cannot make a triangle, it the result is positive, it can make a triangle and will show the triangle, side lengths and angles on screen.
